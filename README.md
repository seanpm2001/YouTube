## My YouTube era

> **Note** This [`README.md`](/README.md) file is a major work in progress and may take a few days to reach a ready state.

### Start of online presence

[`Scratch`](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/seanspokane2015/) was the first instance of my stable online presence, predating the start of my YouTube era by just a few months.

### SeanTRM era

I started my YouTUbe career with the name `SeanWallaWalla` but had the nickname `SeanTRM` as part of a [knockoff of another YouTuber](#) it wasn't the best way to start, and was phased out within the first year.

### Monetization theft

During my attempt to reach $100 off of YouTube advertising revenue (the minimum to redeem it) my monetization was cut off at around $19 to $21 because of YouTube increasing the minimum requirements to an insanely high level (4000 hours per year, instead of reaching 10000 views) I had already been using an adblocker at this time, this just further justified it for me, especially after ad revenue was no longer given to users, even when ads played on their videos (where monetization couldn't be turned off)

If you haven't already, please install an extension like uBlock origin. It is a first-line defense (browser anti-virus) for preventing bad scripts from being loaded onto your computer, and can act as a net for scripts, before they hit your actual anti-virus. When a website tells you to turn off your adblocker, and you are using uBlock origin, **avoid that site!** it is basically saying "Please disable your anti-virus before continuing to our site" which is incredibly sketchy/shady. You can get that content elsewhere on the Internet, and if you can't, it simply isn't worth it.

#### Attempts at DeGoogling

This section is empty right now.

#### Data takeout plans

I have been attempting to find the time to takeout my Google account data (a major step in my DeGoogling) but am having significant difficulty, as there is over 8 terabytes, with a 1 week download window, and a lack of available devoted hard drive space for this.
